    value: Answer the multiple-choice question. Think step-by-step.
    role: system prompt for a multiple-choice question-answering language model
    addendum: >-
      The last line of your response must always and only be of the following
      format: "Answer: LETTER" (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCDEFGHIJ.
    addendum_role: formatting instructions for the last line of the language model's response

# Proposal
likelihood_loss_text: >-
  You will be given a multiple-choice question and an answer attempted by a
  language model. Evaluate the attempted answer. Be smart, logical, and very
  critical. Do not solve the question just provide concise feedback.
likelihood_loss_role: answer evaluation instructions for the multiple-choice task
likelihood_loss_input_roles: ["question", "correct answer", "attempted answer"]

# MCMC
likelihood_answer_regex: (Answer:\s*)[A-J]
likelihood_param_addendum: >-
  The last line of your response must always and only be of the following
  format: "Answer: LETTER" (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCDEFGHIJ.
prior_meta_prompts:
  # Each param can have its own prior -- make sure the order is the same as in `params_data` above
  - >-
    Generate a good system prompt for a multiple-choice question-answering language
    model. The system prompt must be concise and generic and works with any question.
