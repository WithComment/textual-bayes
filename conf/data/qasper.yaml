# Proposal
likelihood_loss_text: >-
  You will be given a question related to scientific research papers and an answer attempted by a
  language model. Evaluate the attempted answer. Be smart, logical, and very critical.
  Do not solve the question. Just provide concise feedback.
likelihood_loss_role: answer evaluation instructions for the scientific research paper reading comprehension task
